# How to contribute (WIP)

- If you would like to contribute to existing code, please make sure to **fork** the respective repository and submit a PR. Please keep in mind that resolving 
conflicts and merging are a bit annoying for Jupyter Notebooks. If you are new to collaborating on GitHub, the 
instructions [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/github-collaboration/) might be helpul. Happy sciencing ðŸ’» ðŸŒŠ
